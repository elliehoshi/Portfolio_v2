        No, why, what's a matter? That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid. What did she say? It's your mom, she's tracked you down. Quick, let's cover the time machine. Alright, good-bye Einy. Oh, watch that re-entry, it's a little bumpy.

        Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance. My god, it's my mother. Put your pants back on. Well gee, I don't know. Quiet down, I'm sure the car is fine. No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George.
        <br><br>
        What, well you mean like a date? Yeah, sure, okay. Alright, let's set your destination time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It's be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas. Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till- What?
